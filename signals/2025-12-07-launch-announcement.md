# ROKO Network Unveils New Digital Presence and Development Roadmap

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE** | December 7, 2025

*Time Verification Infrastructure Project Launches Public Documentation and Communication Channels*

---

[ROKO Network](https://roko.network), currently developing decentralized time verification infrastructure for blockchain networks, today announced the launch of its public-facing websites and renewed community engagement initiatives. The launch includes the main platform ([roko.network](https://roko.network)), technical documentation ([docs.roko.network](https://docs.roko.network)), and news portal ([news.roko.network](https://news.roko.network)).

After an extended period of focused development, ROKO is reestablishing public communications to share progress on its temporal verification protocol, which aims to provide hardware-attested timestamps to blockchain networks.

> "We've been heads down building the technical foundation. It's time to open our development process to the community as we approach our testnet launch in Q1 2026."

## Development Timeline

ROKO Network is currently in active development with the following milestones:

| Timeline | Milestone |
|----------|-----------|
| **Q1 2026** | Testnet launch with initial node operators |
| **Q2/Q3 2026** | Mainnet deployment pending successful testnet phase |
| **Ongoing** | Documentation updates, community feedback integration, and technical refinements |

The project focuses on implementing Precision Time Protocol (PTP) standards with hardware attestation to enable nanosecond-precision timestamps for blockchain applications. Potential use cases under exploration include MEV protection, regulatory compliance timestamps, and cross-chain coordination.

## Resources Now Available

The newly launched documentation portal provides:

- Project overview and technical architecture
- Development roadmap and milestone tracking
- API specifications (coming with testnet)
- Community contribution guidelines

> "We're sharing our work in progress. The documentation will evolve as we build, and we welcome technical feedback from the community."
