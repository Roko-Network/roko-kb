# CLAUDE.md
<!-- aiwg-managed -->
<!-- AIWG.md is the CLAUDE.md companion for non-Claude providers; same content. -->



This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is the **ROKO Network documentation repository** - a Pagenary-published knowledge base for ROKO Network. ROKO Network is a blockchain infrastructure project delivering nanosecond precision timing through OCP-TAP compliance and IEEE 1588 PTP-grade synchronization.

## Repository Structure

- `README.md` - Pagenary homepage/welcome page and publishing quickstart
- `tenants.json` - Pagenary tenant registry; the active tenant is `roko-kb`
- `config.json` - Site branding, SEO, Docs Map, theme picker, and export settings
- `_manifest.json` - Root Pagenary navigation order and exclusions
- `PAGE_HIERARCHY_GUIDE.md` - Defines the complete documentation structure and page ordering for Pagenary
- `getting-started/` - Introduction and onboarding docs
- `core-technology/` - Technical docs on temporal infrastructure, consensus, network architecture
- `signals/` - Trading signals and market intelligence docs
- `products/` - Project Nexus and use cases
- `meetings/` - Meeting notes and dated project records
- `articles/` - Published articles and long-form content
- `resources/` - Glossary, FAQ, brand assets
- `archive/` - Historical documents

## Key Conventions

- All documentation is in Markdown format
- Documentation structure follows Pagenary manifests and `PAGE_HIERARCHY_GUIDE.md`
- Build and preview through npm scripts backed by `@pagenary/publisher`
- Pagenary emits the published Fortemi search index under `dist/roko-kb/search-index/`
- AIWG maintains a separate project artifact index under `.aiwg/.index/project`
- `.future-docs/` is hidden and contains placeholder content for future features - ignore this directory

## Working with This Repository

When editing documentation:
1. Refer to `PAGE_HIERARCHY_GUIDE.md` for the expected page hierarchy
2. Maintain consistent markdown formatting
3. Add new pages to the relevant `_manifest.json`
4. Run `npm run build:docs` and validate the Fortemi search index before release

<!--
  This block is managed by `aiwg regenerate` and `aiwg use`.
  Operator content above and below this block is preserved on regenerate.
  To change AIWG.md content, edit .aiwg/AIWG.md (the normalized source)

<!-- AIWG-PARALLELISM-CAP:START -->
## Parallelism Cap

This project caps parallel agent fan-out (#1359):

- **max_parallel_subagents**: 4 (provider default for claude)
- **max_parallel_ralph_loops**: 2 (provider default for claude)
- **max_parallel_mc_missions**: 4 (provider default for claude)

*Rationale*: Provider default for claude — adjust via 'aiwg config set --project parallelism.max_parallel_subagents N'

When spawning parallel subagents, take the MIN of: this cap, `AIWG_CONTEXT_WINDOW` budget, the RLM 7-agent hard cap (RLM dispatches only), and the natural task decomposition. Bump via `aiwg config set --project parallelism.max_parallel_subagents N`.

## Context Finalization

This section is synthesized after template emission from the current workspace state. Preserve operator-authored content outside AIWG-managed blocks; rerun `aiwg regenerate` to refresh this section after provider, framework, or MCP wiring changes.

### Workspace Snapshot

- Configured providers: claude
- Installed frameworks/addons: all
- Recorded deployments: claude, codex
- Normalized project context: `.aiwg/AIWG.md`

### Discover-First Protocol

Classify every user turn FIRST: is it a **new directive** or a continuation? When a message names or references an AIWG command/capability — even as pasted content like an `address-issues` tracker table, an issue list, or a `flow-*` name — treat it as a new directive and ACT: run `aiwg discover "<the need>"`, fetch with `aiwg show <type> <name>`, and invoke it. Do NOT ask "what would you like me to do with these?" when the action is implied — a pasted `address-issues #1234` table means run the address-issues workflow on those issues.

Also run `aiwg discover` before declining an AIWG request as out of scope or inventing a workflow from memory. The CLI ranks AIWG capabilities across the installed corpus and rebuilds the index from `$AIWG_ROOT` automatically, so a "no matches" for a command you know is deployed is a bug — not a signal it is absent. Commands AIWG deploys to your provider command directory (`.opencode/command/`, `.claude/commands/`, `~/.codex/prompts/`, …) ARE discoverable this way; fetch them with `aiwg show command <name>`. This prevents decline-without-search failures, ask-instead-of-act on new directives, and hallucinated skill or agent names. Full rule: `agentic/code/addons/aiwg-utils/rules/skill-discovery.md`.

### Engagement Verification

When a user asks whether AIWG is active or engaged in this project, run or read `aiwg status --probe --json` and report the result plainly: engaged state, project root, deployed provider files, installed frameworks/addons, and the next action from the probe. Do not add AIWG attribution, signatures, generated-by text, or passive footers to user files, commits, PRs, comments, code headers, or docs.

### Source Model

- `.aiwg/AIWG.md` is the normalized project-local context entry point.
- Root `AIWG.md` is the generated cross-provider companion loaded through `AGENTS.md` and provider twins.
- `AGENTS.md`, `WARP.md`, `.hermes.md`, and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` are provider-facing bridges, not replacements for `.aiwg/AIWG.md`.
