# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is the **ROKO Network documentation repository** - a collection of markdown files organized for GitBook publishing. ROKO Network is a blockchain infrastructure project delivering nanosecond precision timing through OCP-TAP compliance and IEEE 1588 PTP-grade synchronization.

## Repository Structure

- `README.md` - GitBook homepage/welcome page
- `PAGE_HIERARCHY_GUIDE.md` - Defines the complete documentation structure and page ordering for GitBook
- `getting-started/` - Introduction and onboarding docs
- `core-technology/` - Technical docs on temporal infrastructure, consensus, network architecture
- `technical/` - Whitepaper and architecture specs
- `products/` - Project Nexus and use cases
- `resources/` - Glossary, FAQ, brand assets
- `archive/` - Historical documents

## Key Conventions

- All documentation is in Markdown format
- Documentation structure follows `PAGE_HIERARCHY_GUIDE.md` for GitBook navigation
- No build system - documentation is consumed directly by GitBook
- `.future-docs/` is hidden and contains placeholder content for future features - ignore this directory

## Working with This Repository

When editing documentation:
1. Refer to `PAGE_HIERARCHY_GUIDE.md` for the expected page hierarchy
2. Maintain consistent markdown formatting
3. New pages should fit within the existing hierarchy structure
