# Development Meeting Summary

**Date:** March 20, 2025

## Greenhouse Monitoring and Edge Computing

Joe discussed conversations with a former colleague working on greenhouse automation hardware. The project involves Laura-based monitoring hardware with edge nodes that could integrate with Roko's timing and command-and-control infrastructure. An NDA is being signed to explore collaboration.

## Task Bounty Platform Integration

The team explored integration with a project providing contract boards where users post bounties for work completion. The platform has audited smart contracts and is seeking $5M funding. Roko could provide grants for developers building applications.

## Post-Quantum Cryptography Discussion

Alex initiated discussion about post-quantum encryption and quantum random number generation using entropy from timing nodes. The team discussed the Cosq chip versus Zymbit's root of trust capabilities. Key generation involves combining multiple entropy sources into sufficiently complex keys.
