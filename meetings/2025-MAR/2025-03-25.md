## L1 Development - NPoS Pallet Integration

Anton reported significant progress on the new NPoS (Nominated Proof of Stake) pallet. The team rewrote the staking process to use EVM memory instead of Substrate memory, making staking information accessible to dApps. Most unit tests passing with some original tests needing resolution.

A critical issue emerged: a dependency library changed its name in the Rust ecosystem, breaking the build when combining the new pallet with existing chain. This forced an unplanned upgrade to newer Substrate dependencies. AI tools proved ineffective at complex Rust build issues though they excel at JavaScript.

## Bittensor Subnet Development

Brendon completed design work on time validation mechanism for the Roko subnet. The solution addresses weight copying, delay mining, and miner overfitting issues. The approach combines external API validation (30% weight) with mean average of miner timing values (70% weight).

## Bittensor Ecosystem Intelligence

Slice shared updates from Bittensor core developers: A start button feature will allow subnet owners to fully prepare code before launching. An exploit affecting subnets above #64 is allowing excess emissions. Const Capital offered to loan funds for subnet registration.
