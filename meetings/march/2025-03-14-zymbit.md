# Zymbit Support Session #2 Summary

**Date:** March 14, 2025

## Bootware Installation and Setup

Bob from Zymbit walked the team through bootware installation on SCM (Secure Compute Module) devices. The session covered downloading bootware via curl, installing with zbcli, and understanding the boot process. The system creates encrypted partitions using Zymbit hardware for LUKS key management.

## Image Creation and Management

The team learned how to create full system images using the imager tool, which snapshots the entire disk and creates private/public key pairs. Images are compressed and can be stored on USB or HTTP servers for deployment. Bootware uses A/B partition strategy for safe updates.

## Development vs Production Mode

Joe confirmed encrypted bootware instances can run without flipping devices out of dev mode. This allows development and testing in a secure environment before production configurations.
