# Development Meeting Summary

**Date:** January 9, 2025

## Bittensor Timing Network Subnet

Joe provided updates on timing network infrastructure, clarifying that TimeBeat cards will operate on multiple protocols including a private mesh network for synchronization between Roko nodes. Validators will use industry-standard protocols (NTP/PTP) to synchronize with the mesh's grandmaster clock. The timing service can be accessed without blockchain participation.

## Combined Subnet Design - Timing + Q&A

Brendon presented a combined subnet design merging timing services with question-answering functionality. Miners provide timing services using TimeBeat hardware and answer questions about subnet information using NLP/RAG pipelines. Validators evaluate both timing accuracy and QA response quality with 50/50 weighting.

## Subnet Expansion Planning

The team discussed Bittensor's plans to expand from 64 to 1,024 subnet slots with elimination of registration fees. This makes the meta-layer subnet discovery concept more valuable. The combined timing/discovery subnet is strategically aligned with network growth.

## Hardware Requirements

Hardware requirements defined: 8-16 core CPU, 32GB RAM, 100GB storage, plus time synchronization hardware (TimeBeat cards) for miners. Hyperparameters were defined based on consultation with the opentensor team.
