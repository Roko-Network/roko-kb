## Flywheel Integration Progress

Sykm provided update on Superbridge integration process, outlining requirements: SVG format logo, short token description, Twitter link, and verification tweet. The first step is getting ROCO listed on Superbridge for Base chain bridging, followed by applying to Aerodrome for liquidity pool creation.

## L2 vs L1 Final Considerations

The team revisited whether Roko should function as gas token on L1 or if L2 approach would be simpler. Sykm and Anton confirmed with Substrate, ROCO can serve as native gas token with configurable fees, potentially making transactions nearly free. The L1 Substrate approach provides more flexibility.

## Gas Fee Configuration

Nick asked about setting different gas fees for different operations. Anton confirmed Substrate pallets allow gasless function calls, useful for timing service operations which could be free while EVM smart contract executions still incur fees.

## Bridge Security

Alex expressed concerns about bridge security. The team discussed implementing rate limits on token minting via bridge contracts (XERC20 standard) to cap potential losses from bridge compromises.
