# Development Meeting Summary

**Date:** April 3, 2025 (Late Session)

---

## Subnet-L1 Communication Architecture

Deep technical discussion on how the Bittensor subnet communicates with the Roko L1. The architecture needs to handle timing data validation while maintaining decentralization.

## Timing Integration

Planning for integrating timing services from the subnet into the L1 validation process. Validators use timing data to order transactions and validate block timestamps.

## Cross-Chain Messaging

Discussion of cross-chain messaging requirements for future expansion. The architecture should support communication with other chains beyond Bittensor.
