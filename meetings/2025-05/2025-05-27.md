# Development Meeting Summary

**Date:** May 27, 2025

## Consensus Mechanisms

Deep technical discussion on consensus mechanisms including how timing data integrates with block production. The team refined the approach for temporal transaction ordering.

## Slashing Parameters

Definition of slashing parameters that scale with network size and timing precision requirements. Dynamic slashing ensures security while allowing for legitimate timing variations.

## Network Scaling

Planning for network scaling as more validators and timing nodes join. The architecture must handle increased transaction throughput and timing data volume.

## Time Quality Metrics

Definition of time quality metrics for evaluating node performance. Metrics include drift, jitter, and synchronization accuracy.
