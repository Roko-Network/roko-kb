## L1 Blockchain Architecture

Deep dive into L1 blockchain architecture including tokenomics, time synchronization mechanisms, and hardware integration requirements. The team refined the technical specification.

## Tokenomics Model

Discussion of ROCO tokenomics model including inflation schedule, staking rewards, and fee distribution. The model balances validator incentives with network sustainability.

## Time Synchronization

Technical discussion on time synchronization mechanisms across the network. Validators must maintain precise time to properly order temporal transactions.

## Hardware Integration

Progress on hardware integration with a timing hardware provider devices. The integration layer handles communication between timing hardware and the blockchain node software.
