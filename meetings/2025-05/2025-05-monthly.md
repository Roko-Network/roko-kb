# Roko Network Monthly Update

**Month:** May 2025

---

## Executive Summary

May 2025 delivered a major milestone with the successful Power Roko integration into the staking system. The team also explored carbon credit applications, refined slashing mechanics, and gained valuable insights into traditional banking systems that reinforced the timing network's value proposition.

## Major Achievements

### Power Roko Integration Milestone
Significant step forward in L1 development:
- Successfully integrated into staking system using Substrate framework
- Represents completion of core staking functionality
- Foundation for validator reward distribution
- Token appreciation of $2.3M driven by improved project clarity

### Slashing Mechanics Implementation
Dynamic slashing system designed:
- Parameters scale with network size
- Timing precision requirements enforced
- Penalizes incorrect timing data submission
- Penalizes synchronization failures
- Balances security with legitimate timing variations

## a carbon credits partner Credit Initiative

### Collaboration Calls (May 22)
Three meetings dedicated to carbon credit exploration:

**carbon credits Collaboration Call:**
- Precision timing for carbon credit verification
- Timestamp verification for audit trails
- Data provenance requirements identified

**a carbon credits partner Development Discussion:**
- Partnership discussions with a carbon verification partner (7+ years in carbon credit systems)
- a carbon verification partner has Hedera Guardian integration
- Decision: Leverage partners rather than rebuild verification systems
- a voluntary carbon standard for voluntary markets
- a carbon standard body for compliance markets

### Strategic Approach
- Avoid rebuilding complex verification infrastructure
- Partner with established players (a carbon verification partner)
- Focus on timing service value-add to existing systems
