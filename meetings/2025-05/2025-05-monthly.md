# Roko Network Monthly Update

**Month:** May 2025

---

## Executive Summary

May 2025 delivered a major milestone with the successful Power Roco integration into the staking system. The team also explored carbon credit applications, refined slashing mechanics, and gained valuable insights into traditional banking systems that reinforced the timing network's value proposition.

## Major Achievements

### Power Roco Integration Milestone
Significant step forward in L1 development:
- Successfully integrated into staking system using Substrate framework
- Represents completion of core staking functionality
- Foundation for validator reward distribution
- Token appreciation of $2.3M driven by improved project clarity

### Slashing Mechanics Implementation
Dynamic slashing system designed:
- Parameters scale with network size
- Timing precision requirements enforced
- Penalizes incorrect timing data submission
- Penalizes synchronization failures
- Balances security with legitimate timing variations

## Carbon Credit Initiative

### Collaboration Calls (May 22)
Three meetings dedicated to carbon credit exploration:

**Carbon Credits Collaboration Call:**
- Precision timing for carbon credit verification
- Timestamp verification for audit trails
- Data provenance requirements identified

**Carbon Development Discussion:**
- Partnership discussions with Demia (7+ years in carbon credit systems)
- Demia has Hedera Guardian integration
- Decision: Leverage partners rather than rebuild verification systems
- Gold Standard for voluntary markets
- Verra for compliance markets

### Strategic Approach
- Avoid rebuilding complex verification infrastructure
- Partner with established players (Demia)
- Focus on timing service value-add to existing systems
