## L1 Staking System Development

The team focused on staking system development for the L1 blockchain. Discussion covered DeFi flywheel approval, Dynamic Tau emission mechanics, and various validator staking strategies including DCA, all-in, and waiting for liquidity approaches.

## Subnet Economics

Deep dive into subnet economics and how emissions flow through the system. The team discussed revenue model requirements to ensure long-term sustainability of both timing services and the broader network.

## Validator Staking Strategies

Multiple staking approaches were evaluated: dollar-cost averaging into positions, going all-in on launch, or waiting for initial liquidity to develop. Each has trade-offs in terms of risk and potential returns.
