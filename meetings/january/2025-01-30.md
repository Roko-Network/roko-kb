# Development Meeting Summary

**Date:** January 30, 2025

## Stargate AI Infrastructure Response

The team discussed the $500 billion Stargate AI infrastructure investment. Jesse expressed concerns about centralization of powerful AI models by entities controlling training data. This reinforced Roko's value proposition of decentralized compute with diverse knowledge sources.

## Historical Technology Context

Spice shared insights from economic history noting most markets emerge from military activity, including the Internet and US highways. The team connected this to current AI investments and the importance of decentralized alternatives.

## Hydra Node Development Priorities

Jesse and Chet discussed parallel development approaches. Jesse focused on lowest-barrier client software using WebSockets. Chet explored browser extensions and Tor-based node-to-node connections. Priority is functional infrastructure with centralized coordination before adding decentralization layers.

## Service Abstraction and Docker Containers

Chet elaborated on allowing arbitrary Docker containers as network services. Users could package Genesis simulation environments or specialized inference systems with exposed API endpoints. The network discovers these services for agent utilization.

## Verification and Trust Models

The team addressed compute verification challenges similar to Bittensor's miner verification issues. Focus shifted to response quality evaluation and trust-based policies where sensitive workloads stay within verified circles.
