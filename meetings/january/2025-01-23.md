## Telegram Bot and Multi-Agent Reasoning

Jesse and Connor discussed implementing improved chat history and multi-agent reasoning systems. They referenced DeepSeek's R1 model and retrieval-augmented thinking (RAT) approaches for chain-of-thought processing. The vision includes parallel processing where multiple models analyze messages simultaneously and reach consensus.

## Knowledge Agents and Dataset Diversity

The team emphasized querying multiple knowledge agents on the same topic since different agents have different document structures, embeddings, and datasets. Spice highlighted concerns about models trained on biased data, reinforcing the multi-agent consensus approach.

## Hydra Node Architecture

Jesse outlined the Hydra node system designed for lowest barrier to entry. The architecture uses WebSocket connections where client nodes connect to a centralized Roko host server, eliminating port forwarding requirements. Clients download pre-configured software with embedded credentials.

## Service Marketplace

Chet explained Hydra as a service marketplace beyond LLM inference. Users can offer services like Ollama, Whisper, Piper, timing network, vector storage, or custom Docker containers with exposed APIs. The host maintains a registry of available services.

## Trust Layers and Security

The team discussed implementing variable trust levels for compute distribution. For sensitive inference, policy restricts compute to trusted inner circle rather than broader network.
