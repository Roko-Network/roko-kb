## L1 Development Progress

Stalker (Unforkable) provided update on Layer 1 development work. The team is continuing to add required features to the frontend explorer site. Progress takes time as this represents new territory working with unfamiliar technologies.

## AI-Assisted Development

The team discussed leveraging Mantis (an AI coding assistant wrapper around Claude) for development acceleration. Predictions that within 6-12 months, most code will be AI-written. The team explored using open-source alternatives like OpenManus running on their A100 GPU infrastructure.

## Distributed Computing Architecture

BigM presented an architectural vision for a secure CDN network comprised of developer-owned hardware. The proposal includes using Minis Forum mini PCs ($500-1,000 each) equipped with a hardware security vendor security modules and timing cards. This creates a globally distributed, bank-level security network capable of running 70B parameter models on each node.
