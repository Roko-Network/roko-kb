## L1 Development Progress

Stalker (Unforkable) reported continued progress on the Substrate L1 implementation. Focus areas include finalizing the staking pallet integration and ensuring proper EVM compatibility through Frontier.

## Timing Network Architecture

Deep technical discussion on timing network architecture. The team refined the design for how a timing hardware provider devices synchronize and how validators verify timing accuracy across the mesh network.

## Validator Integration

Planning for validator integration into the timing network. Validators need to both participate in block production and verify timing data from miners running timing hardware.

## Development Timeline

Team reviewed development timeline and identified potential blockers. Resource allocation and priority setting for the coming weeks.
