# Roko Network Monthly Update

**Month:** April 2025

---

## Executive Summary

April 2025 focused on consolidating development efforts around the L1 blockchain and timing network, with strategic deprioritization of other projects. The team made progress on Zymbit hardware security, subnet-L1 communication architecture, and began prototyping automated trading applications to demonstrate timing network value.

## Strategic Focus

### Resource Concentration
The team made a strategic decision to focus resources on:
- L1 Substrate blockchain development
- Timing network integration
- Deprioritizing non-core projects
- Clear prioritization of critical path items

### Testnet Preparation
Comprehensive planning for testnet launch:
- Validator onboarding procedures
- Testing protocols defined
- Community engagement strategy
- Technical debt review and cleanup prioritization

## Technical Progress

### Zymbit Hardware Setup
- Private network architecture for timing synchronization
- Mesh network design ensuring reliable time distribution
- Security configurations established
- Key management workflows documented

### L1 Chain Development
- Token staking implementation advancing
- EVM integration through Frontier pallet continuing
- Integration challenges between staking contracts and EVM layer being resolved
- Substrate pallet customization for ROCO-specific requirements

### Subnet-L1 Communication
Deep technical work on architecture:
- Timing data validation while maintaining decentralization
- Validators use timing data for transaction ordering
- Block timestamp validation mechanisms
