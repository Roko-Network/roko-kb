## Mini Forum MS-01 Node Configuration

Detailed configuration for Mini Forum MS-01 nodes. These compact but powerful devices serve as ideal timing network nodes.

## PTP Time Synchronization

PTP time synchronization via coaxial PPS cables. The precision pulse-per-second signals enable sub-microsecond accuracy between nodes.

## Intel TSN NIC Integration

Integration of Intel TSN (Time Sensitive Networking) NICs to bypass expensive switches. This reduces infrastructure costs while maintaining timing precision.

## Research Platform for Trading

The network serves as a research platform for high-availability trading applications. Precision timing enables fair ordering for financial transactions.
