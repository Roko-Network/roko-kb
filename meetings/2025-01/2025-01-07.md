# Development Meeting Summary

**Date:** January 7, 2025

## Flywheel and Token Bridging

Sykm presented progress on bridging ROCO to the Superchain ecosystem and integrating with flywheel exchanges (Velodrome/Aerodrome). Requirements for Superbridge integration include SVG logo, project description, Twitter account link, and verification tweet. The strategy involves bridging tokens from Ethereum to Base first, then creating LP pools on Aerodrome.

## Masa Subnet Research (Subnets 42 and 59)

The team explored Masa's multi-agent subnets. Subnet 42 focuses on Twitter data scraping for miners, while Subnet 59 (Agent Arena) rewards agents based on Twitter activity and engagement metrics. Miners register Twitter agents and earn rewards based on organic growth and engagement.

## Cookie 3 and Mind Share Analytics

Maptet introduced Cookie 3 as a crypto Twitter analytics platform that measures mind share distribution across topics. The team discussed potential applications including using mind share data to inform trading strategies and exploring monetization through affiliate models.

## Bittensor Timing Subnet Concept

The team discussed two subnet concepts: timing services using a timing hardware provider hardware as subnet miners, and a meta-layer orchestrator subnet for discovering and integrating subnets. The orchestrator would maintain a RAG database of subnet information with LLM-powered discovery.
