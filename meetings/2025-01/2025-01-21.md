# Development Meeting Summary

**Date:** January 21, 2025

## Subnets of Interest

Maptet presented a compiled list of Bittensor subnets worth researching: Masa (agent subnet), Subnet 17 (3D object database), Dataverse (social media scraping), Rayon Labs/19AI (high-performance inference), Gaia/Subnet 57 (geospatial data), Shoots/Subnet 64 (serverless compute), and Taoshi/Subnet 8 (time series prediction). The new dynamic tau system allows staking into subnets planned for use.

## Flywheel Strategy

Sykm prepared a demonstration of Superchain bridging strategy and flywheel exchange integration for a smaller core team session. The presentation covers getting ROCO onto Base via Superbridge, creating Aerodrome liquidity pools, and leveraging vote-escrowed tokenomics.

## L1 Development Proposal Readiness

Stalker (Unforkable) and Sykm confirmed readiness to formalize the Substrate L1 development proposal. The 2-month timeline includes delegated proof of stake, EVM compatibility, ROCO as gas token, and modular pallet architecture.

## Hardware Updates

The team discussed A100 server status with 6 months remaining on current lease. Chet and Jesse want to combine A100 deployment with development tasks. The coolant decision remains pending.
