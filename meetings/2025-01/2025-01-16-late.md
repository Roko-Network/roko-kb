# Development Meeting Summary

**Date:** January 16, 2025 (Late Session)

## Subnet Mechanism Design Review

Brendon presented detailed subnet mechanism combining timing services and QA/discovery functionality. Miners run a timing hardware provider hardware for precision timing and use RAG systems to answer questions about subnet capabilities. Validators evaluate both timing accuracy (drift/skew) and QA response quality using NLP techniques with 50/50 weighting.

## Hardware Requirements

The subnet requires miners to have 8-16 core CPUs, 32GB RAM, 100GB storage, and time synchronization hardware. Validators need similar specs plus compute for evaluation models. Miners run their own LLM/embeddings models while validators use separate models for evaluation.

## RAG Pipeline and Question Answering

Brendon explained the QA workflow: validators generate questions about subnet capabilities, miners use RAG systems to generate answers, and validators evaluate responses using NLP scoring. The system creates an evolving knowledge base about the Bittensor ecosystem.

## A100 Server Status

Chet and Jesse provided update on A100 server deployment. Discussion included using distilled water with glycol mixture for cooling. The team plans a 12-month hosting proposal including development instances for Genesis and Langflow.
