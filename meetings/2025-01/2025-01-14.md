# Development Meeting Summary

**Date:** January 14, 2025

## L1 vs L2 Decision Resolution

Stalker (Unforkable) and Sykm presented comprehensive research recommending a Layer 1 blockchain built with Substrate rather than an L2 solution. Key factors: L1 and L2 require similar development time (~2 months), Substrate provides mature pallet architecture for future upgrades, and L1 maintains full control over gas fees and governance. The decision preserves original tokenomics including DPoS and ROCO as gas token.

## Substrate Technical Advantages

Substrate's modular pallet system allows plugins to be voted on and installed by validators without chain disruption. Full EVM compatibility is achievable via existing pallets, enabling MetaMask integration. Unlike L2 solutions dependent on parent chain blob fees, Substrate L1 offers complete sovereignty over transaction costs.

## Bridging and Token Migration

Discussion covered bridge implementation for migrating ROCO liquidity from Ethereum to the new L1. The team will explore third-party bridge services and custom lock-and-mint bridge solutions. Security concerns about bridge exploits were acknowledged with plans to research best practices.

## Bittensor Subnet Mechanism Design

Brendon presented updated subnet design combining timing services with QA functionality. Miners provide timing synchronization using a timing hardware provider hardware and answer questions about subnet capabilities using RAG pipelines. This creates a meta-discovery layer as subnet count increases to 1,024.
