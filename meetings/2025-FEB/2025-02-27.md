# Development Meeting Summary

**Date:** February 27, 2025

## Timing Network Hardware Distribution

The team discussed distribution strategy for 12-13 time cards to establish initial timing network nodes. Distribution to trusted team members and early supporters helps bootstrap the network.

## P2P Network Setup

Progress on setting up the peer-to-peer network for timing synchronization. The mesh network will connect TimeBeat devices with the grandmaster clock for precision time distribution.

## Machine Learning Competition Model

Discussion of using ML competition models for validator selection or performance evaluation. Similar to Bittensor's approach but focused on timing accuracy metrics.

## PTP Squared Integration

Technical discussion on PTP Squared integration for enhanced timing precision. This provides sub-microsecond accuracy needed for high-frequency applications.

## Quantum Clock Applications

Exploration of quantum clock integration and applications. Long-term vision includes quantum-secured timing for critical infrastructure.

## Subnet Registration Economics

Analysis of subnet registration costs and economics on Bittensor. Understanding registration dynamics helps plan the timing subnet launch.
