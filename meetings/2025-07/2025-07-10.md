## L1 Architecture Redesign

Stalker (Unforkable) reported significant architectural change to address critical attack vector. Users could convert temporal transactions to legacy format, which couldn't be allowed. Solution: created third transaction type (similar to Ethereum EIP-1559) preventing miners from converting timestamped transactions. Requires substantial rework across transaction validation, mempool ordering, and block building.

## Flywheel Project Status

Preparing for meeting with Shadow early next week. Shadow and Tran Tor team requested BitTensor education materials. Team prepared BitTensor educational materials including tau stats and ecosystem snapshots. Focus on increasing BitTensor EVM visibility through DeFi Llama integration.

## Developer Interviews Continuing

Manitcor continues interviewing Rust developer candidates. Team members to participate in second-round interviews for good fit assessment.
