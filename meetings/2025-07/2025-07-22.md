## L1 Development Breakthrough

Stalker (Unforkable) reported successful validation of pallet-based architecture for temporal transactions. Testnet producing blocks correctly with proper transaction ordering. Approximately 95% of unit tests passing. All RPC API functions implemented for querying temporal information. Code pushed to main Roko Network repository.

## Time RPC Integration Status

Time RPC backend functionally complete with key rotation capabilities, slippage tolerance settings, and support for up to 100 valid TimeRPC keys with expiry dates. Admin functions exist for emergency key removal. Integration pipeline: user sends transaction to Time RPC which verifies, signs with precise time, forwards to mempool.

## Hardware Setup

Manitcor's a hardware security vendor hardware working properly, focused on creating efficient time extraction loop. Nearly ready to run CM5 node. Team discussed need for updated a hardware security vendor/a timing hardware provider configuration files.

## MEV Bot Development

Connor demonstrated ongoing work on multi-chain MEV bot with complex infrastructure. Gas estimation issues identified. Sy offered to help troubleshoot.
