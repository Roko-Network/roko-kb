## Testnet Running with Final Issues

Stalker (Unforkable) reported testnet successfully running and producing temporal blocks accepted by consensus. Time RPC has extensive features integrated. Final blocking issue is signature verification inconsistency between Rust libraries (node-side) and JavaScript libraries (Time RPC-side). Stalker (Unforkable) successfully generated proper temporal transaction in Rust accepted by testnet, confirming testnet works. Issue isolated to JavaScript cryptographic library data formatting.

## Time RPC Security and Key Management

Time RPC includes comprehensive key management: support for multiple TimeRPC keys (up to 100), key expiration dates, automatic validation, slippage tolerance configuration, and automatic key generation. Admin functions exist for emergency key removal.
