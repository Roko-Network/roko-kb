# Development Meeting Summary

**Date:** July 17, 2025

## Major L1 Architecture Revision

Stalker (Unforkable) provided detailed technical explanation of architectural pivot. Original design attempted new transaction/block structures to embed temporal metadata but proved incompatible with Frontier's type system without forking entire Frontier stack. New architecture stores temporal metadata in separate pallet using hash mapping, maintaining compatibility with standard Substrate and Frontier while achieving identical functionality.

## AI-Powered Development Philosophy

Team discussed embracing AI-assisted development. Developers focus on being code reviewers and keeping AI systems on track rather than writing most code manually. Stalker (Unforkable) noted AI tools are substantially better at JavaScript than Rust, influencing technology choices for Time RPC.
