# Development Meeting Summary

**Date:** December 4, 2025

## Validator Platform

The backend for a new validator onboarding platform is nearing completion. Built in Go, the platform will enable users to generate validator keys, acquire testnet tokens via faucet, and automatically join the network. A frontend interface is in development to streamline the onboarding process. Docker images for simplified node deployment are also planned.

## Temporal Transactions

Work continues on the time-ordering system for transaction sequencing. The team is currently running a timer PC implementation while development on backdating prevention and mempool synchronization progresses. Of note: BitTensor recently implemented a centralized encrypted mempool to address MEV — a solution the Roko team had previously considered but deprioritized in favor of a more decentralized approach.

## Wallet Development

Development is beginning on a dedicated Roko wallet interface. The wallet will be a streamlined version of Polkadot.js, focused on core functionality: balance display, transfers, and chain connectivity. It will also include debugging tools for internal testing and serve as the primary interface for testnet demonstrations.

## Infrastructure

New server hardware is expected to arrive shortly. The team is also evaluating affordable hardware configurations for community node operators, including the OCP Time Hat and various single-board computer options. The goal is to lower the barrier to entry for running timing nodes.

## Documentation

The documentation site is in final review. Updates include improved rendering for diagrams, refined content formatting, and overall presentation polish. An announcement will accompany the site launch.

## Community Growth

The team discussed strategies for developer onboarding, including micro-grant programs and hackathons. Proposed structure: developers complete a bounty task and receive a Roko node as a reward. This approach helps vet participants while distributing hardware to engaged community members.
