# Development Meeting Summary

**Date:** July 15, 2025

## AI-Assisted Development Workflows

Team shared extensive experiences using Claude Code and AI-powered development tools. Joe described using git forensics with Claude Code to fix broken branches. Anton detailed workflow using detailed implementation plans reviewed by multiple AI models, then executing step-by-step with validation. The team emphasized extensive documentation and code comments are critical for AI tools.

## Meeting Schedule Discussion

Slice proposed adjusting Roko meeting time to allow European team members to attend BitTensor open dev calls (Church of Rao). Compromise: keep Roko meeting same time, allowing interested members to catch first 30 minutes of open dev call.

## L1 Development - Architecture Pivot

Anton explained major architectural pivot necessitated by Frontier/Substrate compatibility challenges. Original plan to create new transaction structures hit dead end. New architecture stores temporal metadata in separate pallet using hash mapping. More maintainable and works with existing block explorers. AI rewrote entire codebase in under 2.5 hours.

## Timing Services and Tokenomics

BigM led discussion on timing service economics. Topics included ROI for hardware purchases (~$5,000 for TimeBeat equipment), usage-based vs flat rate pricing, and emission rates for node operators.
