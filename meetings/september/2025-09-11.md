## Anti-Spoofing Mechanisms

Technical discussion on proving validators use actual timing hardware rather than spoofing. Critical for network integrity and timing accuracy guarantees.

## Polkadot Partnership Discussions

Update on Polkadot partnership discussions with potential grant in the $2-10M range (highly variable, with some discussions as low as $100-200K). The partnership would provide additional funding for development.

## MEV Resistance

Discussion of MEV resistance through time-based ordering. The timing network provides fair ordering for all participants regardless of position.
