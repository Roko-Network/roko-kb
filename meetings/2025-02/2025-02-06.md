## Timing Network Design

The team discussed timing network architecture including validator integration strategy, time node capabilities, and proof of capability mechanisms. The design focuses on how validators verify timing accuracy and drift data from miners running a timing hardware provider hardware.

## Marketing Strategy

Discussion covered marketing approaches for the timing network including positioning relative to existing solutions. The team emphasized building case studies to demonstrate efficiency improvements from precision timing services.

## Database Consolidation

Technical discussion on consolidating data structures for the L1 development. The team reviewed how to efficiently store timing data alongside transaction information without bloating the blockchain.

## L1 Development Progress

Stalker (Unforkable) reported progress on the Substrate-based L1 implementation. Work continues on integrating the staking system with ROCO tokenomics and ensuring EVM compatibility through the Frontier pallet.
