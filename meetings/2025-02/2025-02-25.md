## L1 Explorer Development

Anton detailed challenges with L1 explorer development, comparing Polkascan vs Subscan options. The team needs to balance feature richness with customization requirements for temporal data display.

## Production vs Testnet Strategy

Discussion on whether to run separate production and testnet environments or use a unified approach. The team leaned toward separate environments for stability.

## Hardware Requirements

Defined hardware requirements for node operators: Pi 5 + 1TB M.2 SSD as minimum specification. This balances cost accessibility with performance needs for the timing network.

## Hydra Edge Device Integration

Conceptual discussion on integrating Hydra edge devices with the timing network. These devices could serve as entry points for distributed compute while maintaining timing synchronization.

## Cloud Provider Research

Research into Stormy Cloud as an alternative hosting provider at 1/4 cost of AWS. Cost reduction in infrastructure is critical for network sustainability.
