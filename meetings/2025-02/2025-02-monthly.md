# Roko Network Monthly Update

**Month:** February 2025

---

## Executive Summary

February 2025 focused on advancing the L1 blockchain development with particular emphasis on the staking system, validator economics, and timing network infrastructure. The team executed TAO DCA strategies across multiple Bittensor subnets and made progress on hardware specifications for community node operators.

## Technical Progress

### L1 Staking System Development
- DeFi flywheel approval process defined
- Dynamic TAO emission mechanics designed
- Multiple validator staking strategies evaluated:
  - Dollar-cost averaging into positions
  - All-in approach at launch
  - Waiting for initial liquidity development
- Revenue model requirements established for long-term sustainability

### L1 Explorer Development
- Evaluated Polkascan vs Subscan options
- Identified customization requirements for temporal data display
- Challenges encountered with balancing feature richness and customization needs
- Decision made to run separate production and testnet environments

### Timing Network Design
- Validator integration strategy refined
- Time node capabilities documented
- Proof of capability mechanisms designed
- Marketing strategy discussions for positioning timing services

## Infrastructure Updates

### Hardware Specifications Defined
- Minimum node requirements: **Pi 5 + 1TB M.2 SSD**
- Balance between cost accessibility and performance needs
- Time card distribution planned for 12-13 units to establish initial network

### Cloud Provider Research
- Evaluated **Stormy Cloud** as alternative hosting at 1/4 cost of AWS
- Cost reduction critical for network sustainability

### P2P Network Setup
- Mesh network configuration for timing synchronization
- a timing hardware provider devices connecting to grandmaster clock
- Industry-standard protocols (NTP/PTP) for validator synchronization
