# Welcome to ROKO Network

## The Temporal Layer for Web3

ROKO Network is revolutionary blockchain infrastructure delivering **nanosecond precision** timing through **OCP-TAP compliance** and **IEEE 1588 PTP-grade synchronization**. We're building the foundation for time-sensitive decentralized applications that were previously impossible.

## Why ROKO?

### ⏱️ **Nanosecond Precision**
First blockchain with hardware-attested timestamps providing sub-100 nanosecond accuracy, enabling truly deterministic smart contract execution.

### 🔒 **MEV-Resistant by Design**
Temporal ordering based on actual signing time eliminates front-running and MEV attacks, ensuring fair transaction sequencing for all participants.

### 🏭 **Datacenter-Grade Standards**
Built on Open Compute Project Time Appliance Project (OCP-TAP) specifications with IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol for enterprise reliability.

### ⚡ **Predictable Performance**
2-3 second block times with guaranteed finality, sub-penny gas costs, and deterministic execution guarantees.


**Built with Temporal Precision** ⏱️
