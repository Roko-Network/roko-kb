# Project Rosé

[Project Rosé](https://rosé.selfient.xyz/) is part of the [Selfient](https://selfient.xyz) Web3 ecosystem, extending the platform's no-code smart contract capabilities. Built on the same foundation as [Selfient's](https://selfient.xyz) decentralized escrow solution, [Project Rosé](https://rosé.selfient.xyz/) enables users to create and execute smart contracts on the Polygon blockchain without coding knowledge.

The [Selfient](https://selfient.xyz) platform transforms traditional business agreements into immutable, enforceable contracts with features including:

- **No-code contract creation** using the SEA Wizard tool
- **Decentralized escrow** that locks funds until agreement conditions are met
- **Automated payments** via one-time, milestone, or linear payment structures
- **Multi-currency support** (USDC, wETH)
- **Enterprise-grade security** with Hashlock audit certification
