# Project Rosé

Project Rosé is part of the Selfient Web3 ecosystem, extending the platform's no-code smart contract capabilities. Built on the same foundation as Selfient's decentralized escrow solution, Project Rosé enables users to create and execute smart contracts on the Polygon blockchain without coding knowledge.

The Selfient platform transforms traditional business agreements into immutable, enforceable contracts with features including:

- **No-code contract creation** using the SEA Wizard tool
- **Decentralized escrow** that locks funds until agreement conditions are met
- **Automated payments** via one-time, milestone, or linear payment structures
- **Multi-currency support** (USDC, wETH)
- **Enterprise-grade security** with Hashlock audit certification
